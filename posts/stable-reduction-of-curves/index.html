    <p>Five years  ago in the last year of my bachelor studies, while writing my thesis in algebraic geometry, I decided to take a seminar called
&ldquo;Stable Reduction Of Curves&rdquo;. It seemed intriguing: prerequesites were basics of scheme theory (i.e. Chapter II and parts of Chapter III of Harthsorne)
and so far I hadn&rsquo;t seen many applications of all that wondrous and intimidating machinery that is scheme based algebraic geometry to the realm of number theory.</p>
<p>And see, that&rsquo;s also kind of where the problems started: I hadn&rsquo;t really seen much algebraic number theory so far. I didn&rsquo;t even know
what quadratic reciprocity was! (And I still don&rsquo;t <em>really</em> know, if I&rsquo;m being honest.) So even while I understood &ldquo;my&rdquo; small corner of the proof, I never really made sense of the big picture. Now, five years later (and, because I switched fields, with no additional algebraic geometry knowledge at my disposal), I&rsquo;ll try to understand what exactly this was all about.</p>
<p>The seminar was based on a <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82106467.pdf">paper by Artin and Winters</a>, which (re-)proved the following theorem due to Deligne and Mumford:</p>

<div class="theorem">
    <div class="theorem-header">
        <strong>Theorem (Stable Reduction of Curves).</strong>
    </div>
    Let $C$ be a smooth proper curce of genus $g$ over the field of fractions $K$ of a discrete valuation ring $R$ with algebraically closed residue field $k$. There is a finite field extension $K'$ of $K$ such that $C_{K'}$ has stable reduction over the integral closure $R'$ of $R$ in $K'$.
</div>
<p>Even though I knew most of the words, this still read like random jumble. Why on earth would anyone find this theorem interesting much less try to prove it?</p>
<p>So, in the following, I will try to discover why the statement worth proving.
Our journey starts with a equation which we would like to understand the solutions over $\mathbb{Q}$, such as
$$ x^3 + y^3 = 8.$$</p>
<p>After <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_polynomial">homogenization</a> we get
$$\tag{1} x^3 + y^3 - 8z^3  = 0$$
which cuts out a curve in the projective plane.
It is a general principle in algebraic number theory (which we will take as given), that to understand an equation <em>globally</em> (i.e. over $\mathbb{Q}$) one must understand them <em>locally</em> first, i.e. at some prime $p$.
Now if we reduce the above equation modulo $2$ we get
$ x^3 + y^3 = 0$ (as an equation in $\mathbb{F}_2$); which, by the Jacobian criterion, is not smooth.</p>
<p>If we set $w \coloneqq 2z$ in $(1)$ then our equation becomes
$$\tag{2} x^3 + z^3 - w^3 = 0,$$
which stays smoot when reducing mod $2$.
This substitution is an isomorphism over $\mathbb{Q}$. That is, we can recover rational solutions of $(1)$ from rational solutions of $(2)$ and vice versa.
So for our original purpose of understanding the rational solutions, the two equations are basically the same, while the second one is much better behaved when reducing mod $2$.
Speaking in the languague of schemes, we can collect all this information in a <em>model</em> of our curve $(1)$:
<div class="definition">
    <div class="definition-header">
        <strong>Definition.  (Model of a curve $C$) </strong>
    </div>
    Let $C$ be a (normal, connected, projective) curve over $\mathbb{Q}$. A <em>model</em> of $C$ is a normal fibration
$$ \mathcal{C} \to \operatorname{Spec}(\mathbb{Z}),$$
together with an isomorphism
$$ C \simeq \mathcal{C}_{\eta},$$
where $\eta \in \operatorname{Spec}{\mathbb{Z}}$ is the  generic point.
A <em>morphism of models</em> is a morphism $\mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}'$ that respects the isomorphism at the generic fiber.
    </div></p>
<p>So our two equations correspond to the models
$$ \mathcal{C}_1 = \operatorname{Proj}\left(\mathbb{Z}[x,y,z]/\left(x^3 + y^3 - 8z^3\right)\right) \to \operatorname{Spec}{\mathbb{Z}}$$
and
$$ \mathcal{C}_2 = \operatorname{Proj}\left(\mathbb{Z}[x,y,z]/\left(x^3 + y^3 - z^3\right)\right) \to \operatorname{Spec}{\mathbb{Z}}$$</p>
<p>With isomorphic fibers over the generic point (i.e. when interpreted over $\mathbb{Q}$), but with diferent fibers over $2$.
We say $\mathcal{C}$ has a <strong>good reduction</strong> at a prime $p$, if the fibre over $p$ is <em>smooth</em>, and a <strong>bad reduction</strong> if it isn&rsquo;t, i.e we get singularities when reducing.</p>
<p>Now we could hope, given a smooth projective curve $C$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, to find a model $\mathcal{C}$ of $C$ such that it has good reduction at <em>all</em> primes $p$. Alas, that is too much to hope. Still, there is some good news. First:</p>

<div class="theorem">
    <div class="theorem-header">
        <strong>Theorem</strong>
    </div>
    The set of primes $p$ at which $\mathcal{C}$ has <em>bad reduction</em> is finite.
</div>
<p>Second, this is where stable reductions and the theorem of Deligne and Mumford comes in.
A <em>stable</em> reduction is one which is reduced and has at most <em>ordinary double points</em>. These are singularities that look locally like the coordinate axes $xy=0$. Generally we can&rsquo;t hope to do any better than that. Furthermore Deligne-Mumford tells us that we might have to extend our base field slightly and work in a finite extension.</p>
<p>But wait, Deligne-Mumford theorem works over a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_valuation_ring">DVR</a>, we are working over $\mathbb{Z}$, how does that work? Well, if we &ldquo;zoom in&rdquo; at one of the primes $p$ of bad reduction, i.e. we localize at the point $(p)$, we get $\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$, a DVR.
Stated in its full generality the theorem works in the setting of a relative curve over a <em>Dedekind Scheme</em>. A Dedekind Scheme is a scheme that looks locally like the spectrum of a Dedekind Ring, which in turn is a ring that yields a DVR when localized at a closed point.
By localizing at the finitely many bad reductions (and reducing to the case of a algebraically closed fraction field) we arrive at the heart of the matter as stated at the beginning of this post.
(This reduction can for example be found in <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Algebraic-Geometry-Arithmetic-Graduate-Mathematics/dp/0199202494">Liu&rsquo;s book</a>)</p>
<p>When stated in this generality we can apply Deligne-Mumford to other situations as well. Take for example a family of curves over some field $k$ with a parameter t:
$$ y^2 = x(x-1)(x-t) $$</p>
<p>This gives a relative curve
$$ \mathcal{C} \to \operatorname{Spec}(k[t]) $$
Whose fibers over $0$ and $1$ degenerate to &ldquo;bad&rdquo; singular curves since the right hand side has a double zero at $0$ resp. $1$.</p>
<p>While I still don&rsquo;t understand a whole lot of things about this theorem (and practically nothing about its proof), I can finally see how it might be a worthwile result to study. Who knows, maybe I&rsquo;ll even read a book on basic algebraic number theory next.</p>
