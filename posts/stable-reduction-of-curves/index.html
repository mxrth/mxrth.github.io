    <p>Three years ago in the last year of my bachelor studies, while writing my thesis in algebraic geometry, I decided to take a seminar called
&ldquo;Stable Reduction Of Curves&rdquo;. It seemed intriguing: prerequesites were basics of scheme theory (i.e. Chapter II and parts of Chapter III of Harthsorne)
, the seminar was run by a renowned arithmetic geometer and so far I hadn&rsquo;t seen many applications of all that wondrous and intimidating machinery that is scheme based algebraic geometry to number theory.</p>
<p>And see, that&rsquo;s also kind of where the problem with this seminar laid: I hadn&rsquo;t really seen much algebraic number theory so far. I didn&rsquo;t even know
what quadratic reciprocity was! (And I still don&rsquo;t <em>really</em> know, if I&rsquo;m being honest.) So even while I understood &ldquo;my&rdquo; small corner of the proof, I never really made sense of the big picture. Now, three years later (and, because I switched fields, with no additional algebraic geometry knowledge at my disposal), I&rsquo;ll try to understand what exactly we tried to proof there.</p>
<p>The seminar was based on a <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82106467.pdf">paper by Artin and Winters</a>, which (re-)proved the following theorem:</p>

<div class="theorem">
    <div class="theorem-header">
        <strong>Theorem (Stable Reduction of Curves).</strong>
    </div>
    Let $C$ be a smooth proper curce of genus $g$ over the field of fractions $K$ of a discrete valuation ring $R$ with algebraically closed residue field $k$. There is a finite field extension $K'$ of $K$ such that $C_{K'}$ has stable reduction over the integral closure $R'$ of $R$ in $K'$.
</div>
<br>
<p>Even though I knew most of the words, this still read like gobbledigook. Why on earth would anyone find this theorem interesting much less try to prove it?
To unwrap this, I&rsquo;ll zoom out to the very big picture and begin with the question &ldquo;What even <em>is</em> Arithmetic Geometry?&rdquo;</p>
